EU-Forest Metadata Descriptor
Here we provide a summary of the metadata description for the four datasets released in figshare.

1)	Tree Occurrences at species level (csv format)

Filename: 	EU-Forest-species.csv

Coordinates: 	X, Y

Coordinates in a ETRS89-LAEA reference coordinate system (EPSG:3015), representing the centroid of the INSPIRE compliant 1 km ×1 km European grid

Species name: 	Occurrences at the level of species

Dbh: 		Diameter at breast height of the trunk

The class for the diameter at breast height (DBH) of the trunk, which is used to distinguish a new recruit of a given tree. This is presented with two columns: DBH-1 for trunks with diameter smaller than 120 mm and DBH-2 for trunks with diameter larger than 120 mm. The value 1 is used for records with known diameters, and value -9999 for trunks with unknown diameters.
Db Name: 	Name of the database to which the occurrences are belonging to.
These includes 3 columns, name after the datasets: NFI for National Forest Inventory dataset, FF for Forest Focus and BS for Biosoil

EOO: 		Extent of Occurrence for each species

Binary field stating whether or not the target occurrence falls within the species geographical range, measured as the extent of occurrence (EOO, see Technical validation paragraph for details).

2)	Tree Occurrences at genus level (csv format)
Filename: 	EU-Forest-genus.csv
Coordinates: 	X, Y
Coordinates in a ETRS89-LAEA reference coordinate system (EPSG:3015), representing the centroid of the INSPIRE compliant 1 km ×1 km European grid
Genus name: 	Occurrences at the level of species
